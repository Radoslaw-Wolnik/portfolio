# portfolio
portfolio that will have a kubnets setup for hosting my projects and logic behind exploring them

How to set porfolio and demo projects (options)
 - a - Use subdomains: Run your portfolio on `portfolio.yourdomain.com` and each demo project on `demo1.yourdomain.com`, `demo2.yourdomain.com`, etc.
 - b - Use a reverse proxy: Set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx) to route requests to the appropriate services based on the URL.
